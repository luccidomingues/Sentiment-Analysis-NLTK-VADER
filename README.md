# Sentiment Analysis with NLTK and VADER

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis project repository. This project harnesses the power of Python's NLTK library and the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) tool for sentiment analysis. We've also experimented with some basic classification models to further refine the sentiment detection process. 

## Project Overview

Sentiment Analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of computationally determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative, or neutral. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution to sentiment analysis using pre-existing tools and custom models.

### Features:
- **NLTK Integration**: Leverage the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text processing and linguistic data crunching.
- **VADER Sentiment Analysis**: Utilize VADER, a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool, to identify sentiments in sentences.
- **Classification Models**: As an ongoing effort, we've included preliminary models for sentiment classification to potentially enhance VADER's capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can check your Python version using:

```bash
python --version
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/sentiment-analysis-nltk-vader.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages:
```bash
cd sentiment-analysis-nltk-vader
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Provide guidelines on how to run your code, for example:

```python
from sentiment_analyzer import analyze_sentiment

text = "Your text goes here!"
result = analyze_sentiment(text)
print(result)
```

## Models in Progress

We are in the process of integrating more advanced machine learning models for sentiment classification. These models are experimental at this stage but show promising results in preliminary tests. We're exploring:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosted Trees
- Neural Networks

If you have expertise in any of these areas or other recommendations, please feel free to contribute!
